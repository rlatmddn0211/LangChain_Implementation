      "I am particularly interested in researching Multimodal AI applications in the field of healthcare. I believe that combining different types of data, such as medical images, patient records, and sensor data, can lead to more accurate diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and improved patient outcomes. By leveraging the power of Multimodal AI, we can unlock new insights and revolutionize the way healthcare is delivered. I am excited to explore this intersection of AI and healthcare further in my graduate studies.That's great to hear about your interest in researching Multimodal AI applications in healthcare! It's a very promising field with a lot of potential for making significant advancements in patient care. My advice for you would be to focus on building a strong foundation in both AI and healthcare domains. Familiarize yourself with various types of medical data, understand the challenges and opportunities in healthcare AI, and stay updated on the latest research in the field. Additionally, gaining practical experience through internships or research projects related to healthcare AI would be beneficial. As for requirements to join our lab, we look for students with a strong background in AI, machine learning, and preferably some experience or interest in multimodal models. Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions or would like to discuss further."
