The building is seven flights up, with a broken lift that is rarely working. There is a large colored poster of a man\\'s face with a caption that reads \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\" on each landing. The building is one of four similar structures in London that house the Ministries of Truth, Peace, Love, and Plenty.')"
